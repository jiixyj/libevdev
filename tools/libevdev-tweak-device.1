.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I libevdev-tweak-device
tool changes the properties of the evdev kernel device at
.I /dev/input/eventX.
Currently this may be used to force an LED on or off, or to change the
properties of an absolute axis (e.g. its minimum/maximum range or
resolution). Changes are permanent until the device is removed.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Changing absolute axes
.TP 8
.B --abs axis
Change the given named ABS_ kernel axis, e.g. ABS_X. For a full list, see linux/input.h.
Each of the options
.B min, max, res, fuzz, flat
may be given.
.TP 8
.B --min v
Set the absinfo minimum to the value v
.TP 8
.B --max v
Set the absinfo maximum to the value v
.TP 8
.B --res v
Set the absinfo resolution to the value v
.TP 8
.B --fuzz v
Set the absinfo fuzz to the value v
.TP 8
.B --flat v
Set the absinfo flat to the value v
.PP
.SS Changing the x/y resolution
.TP 8
.B --resolution res[,yres]
Changes the resolution of the ABS_X, ABS_MT_POSITION_X, ABS_Y, and
ABS_MT_POSITION_Y axis to the given resolution. If only one resolution value
is provided, both x and y axis are set to the same resolution, otherwise the
first resolution value is applied to the x axes and the second value to the
y axes.
.SS Toggling LEDs
.TP 8
.B --led led
Change the given LED, e.g. LED_NUML. For a full list, see linux/input.h.
.TP 8
.B --on
Change the LED state to on
.TP 8
.B --off
Change the LED state to off
.SH NOTES
.PP
The kernel does not notify processes about absinfo property changes. Any
process that has previously obtained the absinfo from the device will remain
on the old information. This makes using this tool potentially racy, use
with caution.
